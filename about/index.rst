****************
Many thanks to the entire (Intelligent Robotics Lab)[https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs] group at URJC for answering all my questions. They've helped by providing help code, tips, and code reviews.

Also, I'd like to thank the (Leon robotics group)[https://robotica.unileon.es/index.php?title=Home] for testing the implementation with their robot and also for developing the navigation package.

Finally, I'd like to thank (agutig)[https://github.com/agutig] because his (ABR_image_transport)[https://github.com/agutig/ABR_image_transport] project helped me implement the go2_camera module.
