Acknowledgements
****************
Many thanks to the entire `Intelligent Robotics Lab <https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLabs>`_ group at URJC for answering all my questions. They've helped by providing help code, tips, and code reviews.

Also, I'd like to thank the `Leon robotics group <https://robotica.unileon.es/index.php?title=Home>`_ for testing the implementation with their robot and also for developing the navigation package.

Finally, I'd like to thank `agutig <https://github.com/agutig>`_ because his `ABR_image_transport <https://github.com/agutig/ABR_image_transport>`_ project helped me implement the go2_camera module.
